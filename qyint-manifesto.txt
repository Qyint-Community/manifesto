Privacy and Freedom on the Internet are no longer taken for granted in our capitalistic Society, neither is Democracy.
Spying on Users, restricting their Freedom and making Decisions for them is simply more profitable for the Owners.
But we imagine a World without a Profit Incentive and with a truly democratic System - and we will have to build it ourselves.
This Revolution has to take place on the Internet aswell.

+---+
| 1 | COPYLEFT
+---+
The Qyint Community recognizes that proprietary Software and restrictive Licensing Models hinder the Freedom and Autonomy of Users.
We believe that everyone should have the Right to modify and distribute Software freely.
We think that Education - even in the Tech Space - should be available to everyone.
Transparency is important for Trust and Truth.
This is not just limited to Software, but also Hardware and Media.
Intellectual Property, Copyright and Restrictions only limit Progress and the Freedom of Users.
Privacy and Security are Human Rights.
We reject any and all Forms of Surveillance from States and Corporations imposed on us.
The Data Theft and Security Breaches only serve to exploit and control us.
Labeling this as a mere "Conspiracy Theory" is a massive Oversimplification.
It fails to recognize Class War and the tangible Evidence and Incentive to the Practice.
There is enough Documentation proving that the Owning Class is not our Friend.
Mark Zuckerbergs Statement about People who voluntarily handed over their Data to Facebook, calling them "dumb Fucks", cant highlight it more.
Please dont be an Idiot: do not give in to their War against our Human Rights.
All Projects developed within the Qyint Community shall adopt the GNU GPL v3 as their License, as it aligns with our Values and Views.

+---+
| 2 | DEMOCRACY
+---+
We, the People of the global West, seem to take "Democracy" for granted.
But what we see is not a Democracy. While our Government may be democratic, the entire Economy is not.
You do not have a single Word to say when it comes to your Workplace, nor what happens with the finished Product.
We see the Rich getting Richer while more Working Class Citizens have to starve out in the Streets.
They cant just make a Company. Most Capitalists inherited their Wealth or stole it from others by Force.
The entire Concept of "Laziness" or "working harder" is a lie. It serves to distract us from the Injustice and is very Ableist at that.
And we would claim that even our Government is undemocratic.
We elect them with their Promises into Parliament, but they end up doing the Opposite.
This is because Government Officials are lobbied by big Corporations.
After all, why shouldnt they? Its only profitable - and our Economic System is built on Profit.
The Fights in Parliament serve to distract the People and to split them - "DIVIDE ET IMPERA!"
A truly democratic System has to be built bottom-up and without a Profit Incentive.
Democracy has to be present everywhere for a democratic System to be functional.
We believe in Workplace Democracy, as well as Direct Democracy or Representative Systems.
And we are a democratic Community.
There are monthly General Assemblies, where all Members may discuss Policies, Problems and Wishes.
Staff may invite People to the Community.
Membership may be revoked by the General Assembly if the Actions of Members are counterrevolutionary or otherwise break the Rules.
Promoting someone to the Position of Staff is voted on democratically.
A General Assembly may also revert a Punishment, demote Staff, create or destroy democratic Services, etc.
We think respectful Discussion and Debate are are essential to a functioning and transparent Democracy.
Qyint Services are owned by the Administrators:
    MI.SH
    SLAKE
    MINI
Changes to them are made through the General Assembly.
Repositories are owned by their Maintainer.
You can make Changes through the General Assembly or by asking the Maintainer directly,
however the Maintainer may decline.
If the Maintainers Decisions no longer align with our Values, the Repository will no longer be a Part of Qyint.
We try to build Services as transparent as possible.
The General Assembly may also edit or entirely replace this Document, but any and all Changes shall not violate our Core Values.

+---+
| 3 | REVOLUTION
+---+
We believe in peaceful Revolution.
By offering democratic Alternatives and making them as lucrative as possible, we can dismantle the opressive Structures.
Of course, they will fight back and we will have to defend ourselves and our Freedom.
Together, we will build a Future where Technology and Labor serve the common Good, not the Owning Class.
Mutual Aid, the common Good, Transparency, Democracy and Freedom are the Values we fight for.

+---+
| 4 | CONVERSATIONS
+---+
We will always treat others with Respect.
We will always be open to new Ideas.
We will engage in constructive Criticism.
We will not annoy others.
We will not mislead anyone.
We will respect the Boundaries of others.
We will not advertise anything that does not correspond to our Values.
We will not defend or promote reactionary Worldviews.
We will avoid simplistic black-and-white Views.
We will not share NSFW Content, unless it is an NSFW Channel/Tag.
We will not spoiler anyone, or if possible, hide them ||like this||
Most importantly, we have Common Sense.
This is a Social Contract. By breaking the Rules, you violated the Terms and they no longer apply to you.
